    <h1 class = "main-headline">A Look Back at the Great Class of 2022</h1>
    <p>Starting off their Princeton careers in a rainy <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2018/09/opening-exerises">Pre-Rade</a>, the Class of 2022 showed they were not afraid of a little adversity. In fact, throughout their time at Princeton, they exhibited perseverance, resilience, and strength, not least when the Princeton Bubble burst in 2020 with the start of the pandemic, throwing the class into chaos.</p>
    <p>However, the truth is that the Class of 2022 is not solely defined by their experiences with COVID-19. The Class of 2022 is a diverse group of people who were brought together in one of the University’s most selective years (only upended by <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2021/04/princeton-college-admissions-class-of-2025-ivy-league">last spring’s</a> admissions cycle) with 1,941 students admitted out of an applicant pool of 35,370. At the time, this applicant pool was the largest in the University’s history.</p>
    <p>Upon admission, 24.8 percent of students intended to enter the BSE program, and, of those students, 48.3 percent were women, 17 percent were first generation, and 11.2 percent were legacy students. Recruited athletes represented 11.6 percent of the class.</p>
    <p>Although the makeup of the class may have changed, with some members joining the Class of 2023 and some members of the Class of 2021 joining the class, Commencement has finally come, and this year’s Reunions, the first in-person one since 2019, will surely be one to remember.</p>

    <h3 class="year-name">Freshman Year.</h3>
    
    <p>Although the Class of 2022’s first year may have seemed ‘normal’ compared to its successor, it was still far from uneventful. Even before the school year began, the first-years made their mark when their unique rowdiness got them <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2018/09/icc-closes-clubs-to-frosh">banned</a> from eating clubs by the Interclub Council just a few days into Frosh Week.</p>
    <p>The historic moments did not stop there. That year, the class experienced Princeton’s first <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/multimedia/p46fnH3Y7_M">Bonfire</a> since 2012 after the football team remained undefeated in the Ivy League. Students sipped coffee from the newly-founded <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2019/02/coffee-club-is-on-the-grind">Coffee Club</a> — now a beloved campus spot — for the first time ever while they scrolled through the first and most popular iteration of <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2019/10/tiger-confessions-facebook-group-shut-down-days-shy-of-first-birthday">Tiger Confessions</a>. Students also faced the tribulations of the now-infamous ‘<a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2018/10/human-feces-urine-discovered-in-holder-campbell-halls">Campbell Crapper</a>’ as the culprit evaded discovery.</p>
    <p>That year, the Princeton community also demonstrated its unrelenting capacity to push for change. Students <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2019/03/why-were-striking">joined</a> hundreds of thousands of fellow students across the country to urge leaders to act on the climate crisis, <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2019/05/ban-the-box-walk-out">gathered</a> at community-wide town halls on behalf of the “Ban the Box” movement to remove the conviction history question on Princeton’s application, and <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2019/05/title-ix-office-protests-come-to-a-close-after-demonstration-in-front-of-prospect-house">camped</a> out in front of Nassau Hall to protest the University’s Title IX practices. University Trustee Bob Hugin ’76’s run for U.S. Senate sparked widespread campus discourse, as anti-LGBTQ+ and misogynistic rhetoric from his time as part of the Tiger Inn leadership <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2018/09/editorial-on-u-trustee-bob-hugin">resurfaced</a>.</p>
    <p>On campus, students fought to change the room draw lottery process after two students discovered that larger draw groups were more likely to receive earlier draw times and that ordering was the same across 2018 and 2019 for those in the same draw groups — directly refuting claims made by Housing & Real Estate Services. Those participating in room draw this year can thank Adam Chang ’20 and Yang Song ’20 for the changes their <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2019/05/chang-song-room-draw-analysis">investigation</a> brought to the system.</p>
    <p>It was a year like no other, and yet would still prove to be the least tumultuous year of the senior class’s experience. At the end of the day, no student could have been prepared for what hit them the following year.</p>

    <h3 class="year-name">Sophomore Year.</h3>
    <p>Sophomore year was a year of growing activism on campus. In September 2019, Princeton saw arguably one of the biggest <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2019/09/climate-policy-is-public-policy">climate strikes</a> organized by students. A month later, the Davis International Center bulletin board in Frist Campus Center was transformed into a <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2019/10/students-construct-lennon-wall-for-hong-kong-in-frist">Lennon Wall</a> in solidarity with pro-democratic movements in Hong Kong. Within the same academic year, around 100 students, professors, and community members <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/01/students-organize-anti-caa-protest-outside-frist-campus-center">gathered</a> outside of Frist to protest against the Indian government’s Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) enacted on Dec. 11.</p>
    <p>Such activism was admirable in a time of profound losses due to COVID-19. The sophomore class saw one thing after another taken away from them. First, gone was the excitement of being able to search up a precept crush on <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2019/09/tigerbook-removes-information-on-students-campus-residence-hometown">Tigerbook</a>. Not long after that, the original platform where students could bond over the good, bad, and ugly of the Princeton experience — <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2019/10/tiger-confessions-facebook-group-shut-down-days-shy-of-first-birthday">Tiger Confessions Facebook group</a> — was shut down. In light of the increasingly uncertain COVID-19 situation, the Ivy League <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/03/ivy-league-cancels-all-spring-athletic-events-through-end-of-academic-year">canceled</a> all spring athletic events. Meanwhile, internships under the International Internship Program also got <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/04/pics-iip-canceled-summer-2020">canceled</a>, disrupting summer plans of many sophomores.</p>
    <p>However, hardly any day could be more disruptive than March 11, when the University <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/03/all-students-but-those-meeting-specific-criteria-must-return-home-for-rest-of-semester">sent</a> students home for the remainder of the semester. Friendships abruptly severed, plane tickets booked a few days before departure, immense uncertainty about the future of their Princeton career, and an inevitable mental health crisis became the remnants of sophomore spring. </p>
    <p>Within the same year, sophomores also experienced monumental transformations to Princeton’s academics that generations after took for granted. Starting from October 2019, all course communications shifted from <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2019/10/u-announces-replacement-for-blackboard">Blackboard</a> to Canvas as we now know it. After eight decades, Princeton decided to organize <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/02/the-end-of-reading-period-as-we-know-it">finals before winter break</a>, enabling students to have a truly restful time under the mistletoe. Then, in light of backlash from parents and students, the University extended the <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/03/princeton-pdf-grading-option-extended-to-all-courses-as-u-finalizes-its-policy">pass/D/fail option</a> to all undergraduate spring courses. </p>
    <p>As the graduating class walks out of FitzRandolph Gate in a few weeks, undoubtedly facing more uncertainty about life beyond the Orange Bubble, they will look back at their sophomore year and hopefully be reminded that not all hope is lost. </p>

    <h3 class="year-name">Junior Year.</h3>
   
<p>
<strong>Junior year saw an exciting guest </strong>in Richardson Auditorium. In late September, students <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2019/09/the-daily-show-host-trevor-noah-microsoft-president-brad-smith-81-discuss-technology-in-society">packed</a> into the hall to watch Microsoft’s Brad Smith ’81 in conversation with The Daily Show’s host, Trevor Noah. In a few days, the famed comedian will return to campus virtually — this time, as the Class Day speaker for the Class of 2022’s <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2022/04/class-day-2022-speaker-trevor-noah-princeton">commencement</a> ceremony.
</p>
<p>
The academic year of 2019–20 would prove the most disruptive to the Princeton experience in a century. But before all students would be mandated to leave campus and return home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the junior class saw a triumph like no generation before it: Princeton became the <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/02/the-first-to-500-princeton-first-ivy-league-to-secure-500th-ivy-league-championship">first school</a> to secure 500 Ivy League championship titles, with a <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/02/dream-over-dynasty-wrestling-wins-ivy-league-title">long-dreamt victory</a> by the wrestling team setting the Tigers over the edge.
</p>
<p>
On March 11, students were told to pack up and go home. Amid fear, chaos, and a profound sense of loss, some students embraced what felt like “<a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/03/the-end-of-the-world-how-students-said-goodbye-to-campus">the end of the world</a>.” Half-empty vodka bottles, solo cups, uneaten food, and broken furniture littered Henry Courtyard. In what some would later look back on as horrendously irresponsible violations of public health protocol, many students partied harder than perhaps ever before in their time in the Orange Bubble — or ever after, as it turned out.
</p>
<p>
As the semester wound to a close, students adjusted to remote learning, remote<a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/04/rethinking-community-how-student-organizations-are-coping-off-campus"> community building</a>, and remote <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/04/letting-go-of-the-normal-princeton-pandemic-and-religious-life">religious life</a>. Amid a national reckoning over the summer, students debated issues of racial justice online, as one prominent professor <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/07/joshua-katz-black-justice-league-terrorist-organization-quillette-letter-princeton">referred</a> to a former Black student activist group as a “local terrorist organization” and the University <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/06/woodrow-wilson-racism-school-and-college-renamed-black-justice-league">removed</a> Woodrow Wilson’s name from the policy school and residential college. 
</p>
<p>
More than <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/05/students-seriously-consider-leave-of-absence-if-fall-is-online">60 percent</a> of students polled that spring said they would “seriously consider” a leave of absence if the following fall semester were to be remote, but ultimately, enrollment for the academic year 2020-21 would only be around <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/08/deferral-gap-year-covid-2020-one-year">13 percent</a> lower than usual. For the most part, despite uncertainty and burnout, students entered their final year at Princeton as they had started their first: together.

    <h3 class="year-name">Senior Year.</h3>
    
<p>
The Class of 2022 started its senior year scattered. <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/09/300-return-to-campus-covid-testing">Fewer than 300</a> undergraduates were given permission to live on campus in the fall due to the pandemic.
</p>
<p>
The group lost some of its members to the Class of 2022, but not as many as anticipated. For the most part, they remained a collective. But their togetherness would manifest not in Street run-ins, but in long-distance phone calls; not in late nights at Firestone Library, but in late night Zoom meetings; not in residential college communities, but in home communities. Students tried to create community virtually, with some glimmers of success (Though one big attempt, a virtual Lawnparties concert featuring Jason Derulo, was met with <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/09/usg-responds-to-lawnparties-backlash">criticism</a> for its price tag).
</p>
<p>
Some seniors stayed home in the spring too. The members of the class that came to campus would spend their final semester in a drastically different place than the one they had left the previous spring. Eating clubs were closed. Most in-person student activities were prohibited. But seniors tried to make the most of their last few months together, even at a distance. 
</p>
<p>
Despite the challenges of Zoom, it was also a year of activism. Undergraduates and graduate students in the policy school <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/06/woodrow-wilson-school-princeton-petitions-reparations-name-anti-racist-curriculum">pushed</a> for curricular change and anti-racist action. Students in the American Whig-Cliosophic Society <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2022/04/whig-clio-ted-cruz-princeton-award-james-madison">deliberated</a> how their organization honors Sen. Ted Cruz ’92. Community members pushed to <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2022/02/princeton-austerity-protest-covid-19-vaccines-testing">redefine</a> the University’s relationship with the town and <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2022/05/move-bombing-remains-princeton-protest-university-pennsylvania">rallied</a> in response to University anthropologists’ handling of MOVE bombing victims’ remains. And after over a year of deliberation and continued activism from Divest Princeton, the Resources Committee put out a <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2022/05/cpuc-divest-dissociation-fossil-fuel-companies-resources-committee">set</a> of fossil-fuel related recommendations.
</p>
<p>
The end of the year included some high notes. Students started getting vaccinated, with some receiving the shot on campus in late April. Princeton Athletics advanced to the final stage of its reopening plan, with senior rowers, softball players, and track & field athletes able to get in some end-of-year competition. And seniors learned they’d celebrate commencement in person, with each able to bring two guests to Princeton Stadium for the ceremony. 
</p>
<p>
It’s unclear what the senior class will remember about their last few months as Princeton students — a semester defined by restrictions on campus life, burnout, and loss, as well as the beginnings of hope for a post-pandemic world. One thing is for certain: commencement 2022 will be one for the history books.

    <h3 class="year-name">Grad College.</h3>
   
<p>
To finish your graduate degree amid a once-in-a-century pandemic is one thing. To do so at one of the most rigorous and prestigious universities in the world is another. This year’s departing graduate students saw a completion to their time at Princeton unlike any class before them. But even apart from the pandemic, their experience in the Orange Bubble has been one of bearing witness to history. 
</p>
<p>
At the start of 2019, the University <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2019/09/university-admits-most-diverse-graduate-class-in-history">heralded</a> the most diverse admitted class of graduate students in its history. That winter, just two months after a <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2019/10/xiyue-wang-vigil">vigil</a> in Chancellor Green marked the third year of Xiyue Wang’s detainment in Iran, the history graduate student <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2019/12/xiyue-wang-released-from-detainment-in-iran">landed</a> safely at Newark Airport.
</p>
<p>
When undergraduates were told to leave campus mid-March of 2020, most graduate students stayed. Some fought for the University to provide them with adequate <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/03/princeton-graduate-student-petition-coronavirus">sick leave</a>, universal policies, and <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/04/coronavirus-funding-extension-graduate-school">enrollment-status</a> extensions. Several academic <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/09/princeton-department-religion-pips-suspend-graduate-admissions-covid19">departments suspended</a> graduate school admissions, aiming to prioritize their current students, and by summer, labs had begun to <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/06/princeton-phased-resumption-research-work-pandemic-coronavirus">reopen</a> for some graduate programs.
</p>
<p>
The year 2020 also saw a tragic loss for Princeton’s graduate school: Cassidy Yang, a fifth-year student of integrative genomics, <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/12/princeton-university-cassidy-angel-yang-obituary">died</a> in a car crash in December. Yang had been expected to complete her dissertation in May 2022, and her advisor, Professor Joshua Shaevitz, remembered her as “the lifeblood of the lab.”
</p>
<p>
As they remember those who are no longer with them and celebrate the achievements of those who are, this year’s graduate class steps into a world that desperately needs them. With unrelenting courage, soft-spoken wisdom, and a strong sense of social responsibility, they ready themselves to meet those needs.

<h3 class="year-name" style = "padding-bottom: 3px; line-height:0.9">What is closure for the Class of 2022?</h3>
<p><em> By Remy Reya ’22 </em></p>
<p>
We were all accustomed to sitting with strangers in our first days on Princeton’s campus. The newness of the place demanded some degree of shameless self-promotion in order to build our networks of peers beyond those we would eventually encounter in classes and extracurriculars. During orientation, we found ourselves constantly surrounded by strangers, but still willing to look past the unfamiliarity to delve into some of life’s most important questions, like: “did you do OA or CA?” In those early days, sitting with strangers was the norm.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
As we entered our sophomore year, many of us had already begun carving out our niches on campus. Our interactions with strangers became more sparse and more targeted. We ran after strangers passing through Frist Campus Center to promote our shows; we complimented strangers on the Tiger Confessions Facebook page (or tore them down in the comments); we swayed alongside strangers at our hard-earned bonfire.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
As juniors, suddenly, we were the ones bickering the bickerees and evaluating the auditionees. First-years and sophomores looked to us for advice on classes and work-life balance, and we overconfidently delivered. We met plenty of new people — but in general, we found comfort in the pockets of campus we had defined for ourselves. We didn’t need to lean into the friend-making frenzy we had embraced in our first year as Princetonians.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Then, the world shut down. And we were left scattered across it, impossibly far apart with no reunion in sight.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
The new digital landscape created some unexpected opportunities for connection, like Houseparty and the “Zoom Memes for Self Quaranteens” Facebook group. But two semesters fully online, stripped of the wholeness of the community we had envisioned ourselves inhabiting long before our letters of admission had arrived in the mail, were hard to bear. Many of the things that bound us had dissolved; no longer could we walk out of class with our cute seat neighbor or bump into former Zeemates at Late Meal. Classmates were lost to gap years, senior traditions were lost to the digital realm, and the physical dimensions of Princeton that made our lives here meaningful were lost to the new public health regime. 
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Senior year of college is usually a time when people lean into the connections they’ve built over the past three years — to the people and to the place. Our senior year was marked by the beginning of a rebuilding process, back toward normalcy, but not quite there yet.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
But that process has given birth to something else beautiful. In pursuit of the stuff that has long defined Princeton as our home, we’ve harnessed the value of the little moments that serve as the foundation of community. We’ve exchanged knowing glances as the 5-minutes-to-closing bell blares in Firestone Library at 1:55 a.m. We’ve posed for selfies at local businesses together during ’22 in Town events. We’ve joined spontaneous Spikeball matches and frisbee games on Poe Field. We’ve populated dining halls, lounges, and study rooms, and we’ve occupied hundreds of black adirondack chairs across campus, six feet apart but more appreciative than ever to be only six feet apart. In many ways, we have begun to sit with strangers again.
</p>
<p>
And though the end of our time as college students looks radically different from the experience we imagined inheriting, our relationships within this community are in many ways just beginning. For generations, Princeton alumni have gathered across the world and returned to the campus beyond graduation, embracing each other with the same mutual commitment that has bound us as undergraduates. Because of this continuity of community, perhaps we won’t have to wonder about finality in such stark terms; perhaps we can continue to sit with strangers for many years to come.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
As we venture into the world beyond Princeton, let us always remember the unbelievable strength and resilience of the community we’ve built together. And let us always remember how communities like this are made. It all starts with one question: “OA or CA?”
